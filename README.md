## Getting Test aUSDC

If you need test aUSDC tokens for Smart-Portal testing purposes, you can obtain them by following these steps:

### Step 1: Join Axelar Discord

To request test aUSDC tokens, you must join the Axelar Discord community. If you haven't already, you can join by following this link: [Axelar Discord](https://discord.com/axelar).

### Step 2: Access the Faucet Channel

Once you've joined the Axelar Discord server, navigate to the "Faucet" channel.

### Step 3: Request Test aUSDC

In the Faucet channel, you can request test aUSDC by typing the following command:

`!faucet chainName Address`

- Replace `chainName` with the name of the Axelar chain you want to receive test aUSDC on (e.g., "scroll").
- Replace `Address` with your wallet address on the Axelar Network where you want to receive the test aUSDC.

For example, if you want to receive test aUSDC on the "scroll" chain and your wallet address is `0xe57f4c84539a6414C4Cf48f135210e01c477EFE0`, you would type:
`!faucet scroll 0xe57f4c84539a6414C4Cf48f135210e01c477EFE0`

### Step 4: Receive Test aUSDC

After typing the command, you will receive 500 aUSDC in your provided wallet address on the Axelar Network.

### Step 5 : Import it to you metamask you will find the token addrress here
